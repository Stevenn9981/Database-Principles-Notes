**Information** Data with a meaning

> Store data is mostly text, numbers, dates, and (less onen) mulfmedia documents.

### Purposes of Databases

### RETRIEVE data
as efficiently as possible.

## Relational Theory
1970

Edgar F. Codd 1923 - 2003

![](midterm/tables.png)

Each column in the table stores a piece of data, and one row represents a "known fact".

All the pieces of data in a row are related, hence **"relational"**.

### Operate on relations
Codd's big idea was that as relations are well known mathemafcal animals (sets), you could operate on them, and get new sets.

> If tables are variables, you can change their content massively, and combine them in complex operafons to obtain new results, as you could with numbers.

## Modeling

Before you can do fun operafons with tables, you must design your database well, a step known as modelling.

First of all, you must know which data you need/want to manage. It depends on whom you are.

### Film Database

Duplicates are forbidden in relafonal tables.

#### Key

What differentiates one row from another.

Key cannot be changed.

> For purely commercial reasons, though, it may be assumed that the combinafon ftle/country/year will be unique.

#### Primary Key

####  Normalizafon

**First Normal Form**

Each column should only contain ONE piece of informafon.
